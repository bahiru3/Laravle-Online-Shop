This pattern is for major section headings. It has the following options:

1. `c_heading_is_primary_heading` - default is false, but true will set this to an `h1`. Useful for category and tag templates.
2. `c_heading_outer` - a wrapping div that exposes `c_heading_outer_classes`. Useful for adding borders or background colors to the heading.
