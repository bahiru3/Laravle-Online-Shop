The Icon button is comprised of c_icon and c_span. While c_icon and c_span both support URLs, any URL for o-icon-button should be passed using o_icon_button_url. In this case, it will render an anchor tag instead of a button tag.

## Available configurations:

* `o-icon-button.search` â€“ Contains search icon from `c-icon` and no text.
