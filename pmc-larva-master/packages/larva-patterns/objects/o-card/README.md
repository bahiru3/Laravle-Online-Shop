`o-card` is a pattern generally used for a story or article that features a vertical layout. It is a very flexible pattern that includes several options for included components. The order of these can be modified to some extent using flex and `order` utilities, but developers should try to avoid modifying the display order in a way that could impact the experience for users using the keyboard.
