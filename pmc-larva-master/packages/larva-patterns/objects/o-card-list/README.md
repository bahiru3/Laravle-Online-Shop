`o-card-list` is a simple wrapping patttern for displaying a list of `o-card`s. This pattern is only necessary when semantic list elements are useful, or when a storing classes in a central place for the `li` wrapping element is useful.

A future improvement to this pattern would be an option for an `ol` since many of the card lists will be ordered chronologically.
