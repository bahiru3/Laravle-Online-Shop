This module renders Carousel block posts in the Gutenberg editor.

The default pattern renders a primary post, with two secondary posts in the sidebar.

The overlay pattern displays a fuller width primary post with text overlay, and a stacked row of three secondary posts.

The primary post displays section title, a post image and title, author byline and timestamp; the secondary posts display a post image and title only.
