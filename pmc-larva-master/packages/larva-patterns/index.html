		<h1>Welcome to the Larva pattern library for {{brand}}!</h1>
		<p>When viewing this page from a local server, you can use the server to quickly update and build front-end Larva modules. As a static site, this pattern library is for documentation.</p>
		<p>View available patterns by clicking the "Show Larva UI" button on the bottom right. Anything under the "Larva" column is shared across all brands and themed with design tokens. Anything under the "Project" column is a brand-specific pattern. If there is no "Project" column, then the brand is only using shared patterns.</p>
